You can see an example of usage in a BuckleScript project in this folder.
The most relevant point is the `ppx-flags` in `bsconfig.json`, that is pointing to the ppx executable:

```
  "ppx-flags": [
    "../_esy/default/build/default/.ppx/my_ppx_lib/ppx.exe --as-ppx"
  ],
```

To compile the example:

    % esy install

Then you can run

    % yarn build

or

    % npm run build

At that point, you should see the file `src/Index.bs.js` with the following output:

```javascript
// Generated by BUCKLESCRIPT VERSION 4.0.7, PLEASE EDIT WITH CARE
'use strict';


var fourtyTwo = String(42);

console.log(fourtyTwo);

exports.fourtyTwo = fourtyTwo;
/* fourtyTwo Not a pure module */
```
